# openFuelCell2

[openFuelCell2](https://openfuelcell2.github.io/) is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) toolbox for simulating electrochemical devices such as fuel cells and electrolysis. The solver is based on the open-source library, OpenFOAM®.

## About the code

The source code was developed from a previous open-source repository called [openFuelCell](http://openfuelcell.sourceforge.net/). It was also inspired by the standard solver "reactingTwoPhaseEulerFoam" in OpenFOAM®. The solver can consider coupled problems with multi-region and multi-physics issues, including single and two phase flows, multiple species components, charge transfer, and electrochemical reactions in different regions. More applications and solvers will be available in the future.

## How to use

The code is compiled with the OpenFOAM libraries, either [ORG](https://openfoam.org/) or [COM](https://www.openfoam.com/) versions. The default branch is compatable with the COM version, while the other branches are also provided for different OpenFOAM environments. The available environments will include: OpenFOAM-v2012, OpenFOAM-v2106, OpenFOAM-v2306, OpenFOAM-v6, OpenFOAM-v8. Note: this branch is only compatible with OpenFOAM-10, while the others can be found from different branches.

```bash
# Download the source code
# Setup the corresponding openfoam environment
# Switch to the corresponding branch

# Change dictionary to the repository
cd openFuelCell2/src

# Compile the source code with
./Allwmake

# Or compile in parallel
./Allwmake -j n
```

You can also clear the libraries and executable files with

```bash

cd openFuelCell2/src

./Allwclean

```

## Computational domains

---

Take the cross-section of a fuel cell as an example. The computational domain gives,

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/computationDomain.jpg" height="70%" width="70%">
</div>

In a PEM fuel cell or other types, there are several domains/regions: air, fuel, electrolyte, and interconnect. This can be found from the repository [openFuelCell](http://openfuelcell.sourceforge.net/). However, additional domains/regions, e.g. phiEA, phiEC, and phiI are also necessary to account for electron/ion and dissolved water transfer.

To consider the coupling transfer problems in a PEM fuel cell, a global region, also called as parent mesh, and several local regions, also called as child meshes, are used. In the global region, only the energy equation is solved. In the local regions, corresponding partial differential equations will be discretized and solved. During the simulation, material properties, e.g. density, thermal conductivity, etc., are mapped from local regions to the global region, while the temperature field is mapped from the global region to the local regions.

The local regions can be classified as three different types, namely fluid, solid, and electric regions. See the [code](src/libSrc/fuelCellSystems/regions).

- Fluid region:

  This region represents the space where fluid flows by. In a fuel cell or electrolyzer, it consists with gas channels and/or porous regions. In this region, the following processes are addressed:

  - Fluid flow (single/two phase)
  - Species transfer
  - Electrochemical reaction
  - Heat and mass transfer

  For example, in a fuel cell, the following parts apply to this region,

  - Air flow paths + porous electrodes
  - Fuel flow paths + porous electrodes
  - Cooling channels

- Solid region:

  This represents the solid components in fuel cell or electrolyzer. In the current solver, no equations will be solved here. However, stress analysis during assembly and thermal effects may be implemented in future applications.

  For example. in a fuel cell, the following components apply to this region,

  - Electrolyte/membrane
  - Interconnect/Bipolar-plate
  - Endplate

- Electric region:

  This region accounts for the electric-conductive components. It is designed to consider electron/ion transfer specifically. However, it is found that the proton transfer region is the same as the region where dissolved water transfer takes place. Therefore, a switcher is enabled in the code to turn on/off the dissolved water transfer model. The following equations will be solved,

  - Potential equations (Poisson equations)
  - Dissolved water transfer equations (diffusion and electro-osmotic-drag)

  For example, in a fuel cell, the following components belong to this region:

  - Bipolar-plate, GDL, MPL, CL -> electron transfer regions
  - Catalyst coated membrane, CCM, -> proton transfer and dissolved water transfer region

- Global region:

  The heat source/sinks in local regions will be mapped to this region. And the obtained temperature is mapped back to the local regions. The heat source/sink include:

  - Joule heat from the electron/proton regions.
  - Condensation/evaporation in the fluid regions.
  - Electrochemical reactions in the fluid regions.
